## How to answer a metric problem

### **How to structure your answer? We suggest structuring your answer in the following way:**

  - Key: What? For Who? Profit or Engagement? Usage Stages? 

  - Ask clarifying questions to confirm your assumptions (e.g., What does the product do?, Who is the product for?, etc.).

  - State or confirm with the interviewer what the goal of the product is (e.g., increasing conversion, revenue, profits, sales, engagement, retention, etc.).

  - Use the product’s customer lifecycle to drive your analysis of what to measure. For example, think of what to measure at the awareness, engagement, retention and monetization stages.

  - At each stage, identify behaviours that can be defined and quantified with a metric(s). Be detailed and ready to answer how you would gather the data to implement the metric(s).

  - Summarize your analysis.

## Growth

For any Startup, the first thing is to have good products. With good products, we can get users. Only after we get users, we can start thinking about retention. To have good retention is critical for your business. However, what is good retention can be very different depending on the business vetical. For Facebook, 80% retention is bad. For eCommence, 20% retention is good. For Netflix, the retention is about 91% (9% churn rate).

Good retention rate leads to growth. How does the growth look like? Does it look healthy? There must be a North Star for Growth for different business. For Facebook in early days, the North Star is Monthly Active User (MAU) not registered user. For Whatsapp, it's daily sent messages not the DAU. For AirBnB, it's the daily booked nights vs hotels. For Uber growth, the north star metric is the weekly trips. 

One key to good retention is for users to experience the Magic Moment while using your products/services. For Facebook, it's the time when users see friends' pictures, messages, status, etc. When that happens, they get hit and that is the Magic Moment for them. When Facebook reached 50M users, they were afraid because no social media had ever gone pass 100M users yet. At that time, they focused on **10 friends in 15 days** for every new user. This was critial. They did it and they succeeded.

The next thing is about Virality. Whether or not your product/service will go viral? For it to go viral, there is a K-factor, if K-factor > 1.0, it will. 

## Metrics

Metrics are very important for any analytics. Especially for products, good metrics tell all and will be key for business. 

Take Facebook **groups** for example. Metrics for **groups** are all about growth, engagement and membership.

The first question to ask is why Facebook is promoting **Groups**. Facebook is evolving to focus more on building communities, and groups are the natural tools to help forge those new kinds of connections. A Facebook group is a page created for an organization or business to promote activities. Groups “allow people to come together around a common cause, issue or activity to organize, express objectives, discuss issues, post photos and share related content.” On the other side, there is Facebook Pages. Facebook Pages enable public figures, businesses, organizations and other entities to create an authentic and public presence on Facebook.

Compared to **Pages**, **Groups** are more interactive. Businesses can create **Groups** besides **Pages**, and **Groups** will give the 'Super-fans' a chance to interact with each other as well as with the brand itself. **groups** create a powerful ecosystem in which members forge meaningful connections with your business.

So, how do we measure **Groups**? Are they healthy? Echo why **Groups** are created, we want people to interact with each other in the group. So, metrics can be **Number of Members**, **Daily Active Members**, **Daily Conversions**, etc. **Number of Members** can tell whether there are enough people get involved in the group. If a group has few members or one billion members, it does not look good. We also want members to be active in the group, dummy/Mummy members are meaningless. So, **Daily Active Members** tells how many members are active. The **Daily Active Members** only tell part of the story, and **Daily Conversions** tells the other half of the story about how active the group is. Other metrics can be **Number of New Members**, which shows how the group is growing.

  - If you have a two side marketplace, you need to measure something that will benefit both sides, such as finished rides for Uber and transactions for eBay. 

  - Cohort measurement of user retention. This will let you know what happens to users overtime. 

  - Metrics let you measure to make sure that you are in the right direction.
